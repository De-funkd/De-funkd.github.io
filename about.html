                <pre><b>about this site</b>

it runs on my raspberry pi, which lives comfortably in my living room. the setup is
very simple for now, I'm just using FreeBSD and crond to control my services, deploys are
automatic each 6 hours, and everything is run without root privileges. i no longer need DDNS
as i finaly managed to a fixed IP from my ISP, and my router does all the boring stuff like
DDoS protection, firewall and NAT.

All in all, including the OS uses just 200MiB of my precious RAM. it has less than 1kb of
size and renders instantly, this demands less from my rpi and from your browser without
losing style. this is part of my effort to create a better web.
